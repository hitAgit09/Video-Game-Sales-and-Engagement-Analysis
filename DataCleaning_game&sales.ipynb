I didn\\u2019t really want to compare the two, but oh well, everyone else is \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     One key difference is that in Kazooie, each session in a world is somewhat discontinuous. What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world, leave and come back, and you\\u2019ll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie, everything you collect is permanent and you don\\u2019t need to worry about losing progress.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Oh, the camera is much better in Tooie too.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     A common complaint I see is that there\\u2019s an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience. I actually played Tooie first and felt that Kazooie was lacking.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     One significant aspect of games that greatly affects the flow of a game is the feeling of progression. This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it\\u2019s new combat moves, mobility utilities, worlds, secret paths, etc, there\\u2019s always something new. However, because there\\u2019s so much, there is a LOT of backtracking, especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing, but I know it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child, this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     I\\u2019d be lying if I said nostalgia didn\\u2019t have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you, both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20\\u2019s I gave this a solid 10/10.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     There\\u2019s also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign. I had 3 siblings so we had a ton of fun playing these, but I imagine not many of us play couch multiplayer anymore so this is more of a side note bonus thing.', 'Saudades de quando jogos pra

A lot of its charm comes from the humorous dialogue between characters. It\\u2019s packed with quite a bit of dark humor and situational comicalities throughout each of the 9 worlds.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     The worlds are vast and eclectic, meaning you\\u2019re left with very little to be desired and a lot to explore.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Being a sequel to Banjo Kazooie, Tooie has a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint. I didn\\u2019t really want to compare the two, but oh well, everyone else is \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83c\\udffb\\\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0f.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     One key difference is that in Kazooie, each session in a world is somewhat discontinuous. What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world, leave and come back, and you\\u2019ll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie, everything you collect is permanent and you don\\u2019t need to worry about losing progress.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     Oh, the camera is much better in Tooie too.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     A common complaint I see is that there\\u2019s an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience. I actually played Tooie first and felt that Kazooie was lacking.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     One significant aspect of games that greatly affects the flow of a game is the feeling of progression. This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it\\u2019s new combat moves, mobility utilities, worlds, secret paths, etc, there\\u2019s always something new. However, because there\\u2019s so much, there is a LOT of backtracking, especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing, but I know it\\u2019s not for everyone.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child, this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     I\\u2019d be lying if I said nostalgia didn\\u2019t have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you, both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20\\u2019s I gave this a solid 10/10.\\\\n                     \\\\n                     There\\u2019s also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign. I had 3 siblings so we had a ton of fun playing these, but I imagine not many of us play couch multiplayer anymore so this is more of a side note bonus thing.', 'Saudades de quando jogos pra
